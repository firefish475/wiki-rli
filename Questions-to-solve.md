## Secondary display activation in gnome

I am using a Thinkpad X200 with an UltraBase docking station. When docking the Thinkpad the secondary display gets configured and activated.

How can I prevent the secondary display to be used and manually activate it on demand later on?

## Manual network configuration in gnome

I am connecting my mobile using USB to transfer data with SSH. Therefore I use tethering USB mode on my phone and termux with sshd to connect to it from my laptop with ssh.

To continue using the network connection of my laptop (wifi) and not the wifi of the USB-tethering phone I manually "ip route del" the default route to my phone, but in gnome it keeps coming back. How can I prevent this?
