## Secondary display activation in gnome

I am using a Thinkpad X200 with an UltraBase docking station. When docking the Thinkpad the secondary display gets configured and activated.

How can I prevent the secondary display to be used and manually activate it on demand later on?

## Manual network configuration in gnome

I am connecting my mobile using USB to transfer data with SSH. Therefore I use tethering USB mode on my phone and termux with sshd to connect to it from my laptop with ssh.

To continue using the network connection of my laptop (wifi) and not the wifi of the USB-tethering phone I manually "ip route del" the default route to my phone, but in gnome it keeps coming back. How can I prevent this?

## Dual head recommended resolution

 * Does it make sense to purchase a 4K monitor with a native Display Port to drive it with the maximum resolution of the X200 UltraBase?

 * Is the UltraBase max resolution 2560x1600 ?

 * Are there problems with machine slowdown to be expected with such high resolutions?

 * Is the linux kernel intel drive able to drive a Display Port monitor at the maximally possible resolution aka 2560x1600@60Hz ?
