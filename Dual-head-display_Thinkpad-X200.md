# Thinkpad X200 and X200 UltraBase dual-head display

The Thinkpad X200s has one VGA port. So far I only use dual-head with an additional VGA monitor which is connected to the VGA port of the X200 UltraBase docking station. This docking station has a Display Port which I want to connect a monitor to which has a Display Port, too.

Resolution with builtin and vga monitors:

1280x800 (16:10) 60 Hz
1680x1050 (16:10) 60 Hz

both are the maximum selectable in Gnome 3 on Archlinux. But the Display Port monitor should be able to be driven at higher resolutions.

## Questions

 * Does it make sense to purchase a 4K monitor with a native Display Port to drive it with the maximum resolution of the X200 UltraBase?

 * Is the UltraBase max resolution 2560x1600 ?

 * Are there problems with machine slowdown to be expected with such high resolutions?

 * Is the linux kernel intel drive able to drive a Display Port monitor at the maximally possible resolution aka 2560x1600@60Hz ?
